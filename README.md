🔐 Cybersecurity Labs

This folder contains a collection of hands-on cybersecurity labs I’ve built and documented while learning and practicing security concepts. Each lab is designed with a “learn by doing” approach to simulate real-world scenarios used in penetration testing, SOC analysis, vulnerability assessment, and incident response.

📂 Contents

Reconnaissance & Scanning Labs → Nmap, DNS Recon, Metasploit basics

Exploitation & Vulnerability Labs → Web app exploitation, privilege escalation

SOC & SIEM Labs → Wazuh, log analysis, threat detection rules

Malware & Forensics Labs → Static/dynamic malware analysis, memory forensics

DevSecOps & Cloud Security → Container security, CI/CD pipeline hardening

Practice Reports & Notes → Step-by-step walkthroughs, findings, and remediation suggestions

🎯 Goals

Strengthen practical skills in ethical hacking & defense

Build a job-ready portfolio showcasing technical depth

Document labs with commands, screenshots, and reports for learning and teaching

Provide a foundation for certifications like CEH, OSCP, SOC Analyst
